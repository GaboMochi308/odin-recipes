        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>This <strong>garlic bread recipe</strong> is foolproof for just about any occasion, especially summer cookouts, 
            gatherings with friends, or family dinners. It is prepared in a short time and can solve an 
            appetizer or snack at any time, and it is also a versatile recipe that we can adapt to our tastes.</p>

        <p>To make it a success, try to choose a good bread, baguette style or rustic loaf with little crumb and not 
            too thick, and a good butter. The amount of garlic is up to your taste, although I think 3 medium-sized 
            cloves for a large stick are perfect. This is a basic recipe that <strong>we can enrich</strong> by adding Parmesan cheese 
            to the mixture with which to paint the bread. I assure you that without cheese it is an equally addictive 
            delight.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>

            <li>1 baguette or rustic loaf of firm crumb and good crust</li>
            <li>Unsalted butter</li>
            <li>65 g warm</li>
            <li>30 ml extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1g lemon zest</li>
            <li>4g granulated garlic</li>
            <li>3 clove of garlic</li>
            <li>Ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese optional</li>
            <li>Coarse or flake salt</li>
            <li>Fresh parsley</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>

           <li>- Preheat the oven to 180ÂºC and prepare a tray by covering it with parchment paper. Make sure the 
               butter is at room temperature, with a soft texture. Wash and dry the lemon well. Peel the garlic 
               cloves and <strong>chop them very fine</strong>. Cut the loaf of bread into 
               slices about one finger thick</li> 

           <li>- Arrange the softened butter in a bowl and add the olive oil, the lemon zest, the minced garlic cloves, 
               a dash of black pepper, the granulated garlic, a pinch of coarse salt and a tablespoon of Parmesan 
               cheese, if used. . Mix everything very well until leaving a <strong>creamy texture</strong></li> 

           <li>- Spread each slice of bread with the creamy paste using a kitchen brush, or a butter knife. Arrange 
               them on the prepared tray and <strong>bake for about 12-15 minutes</strong>, until the butter has melted and the 
               bread is nicely browned. Chop parsley and add it before serving.</li> 

        </ol>
