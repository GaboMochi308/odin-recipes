        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p><strong>Lasagna (Italian: lasagna)</strong> is a type of pasta. It is usually served in overlapping sheets interspersed with 
            layers of ingredients to taste, most often meat (ragù) in bolognese sauce and bechamel. 
            Its origin is Italian and the dish usually prepared with meat is usually called baked lasagna.
             Baked lasagna can also be made with vegetables (spinach, aubergines, etc.) or fish.</p>

        <p><strong>It ends with <em>bechamel sauce</em></strong> and plenty of grated cheese to gratin it in the oven. The word <em>"lasanum"</em>
             comes from the Greek <em>"lasanum"</em>, through the Latin <em>"lasanum"</em>, which refers to the pot in which it was cooked. 
             The singular word in Italian is lasagna and in the plural lasagne is applied indistinctly to the dish or to the pasta in the form of sheets. 
            It is a hot starter or first course that is usually eaten in winter or in the cold periods of spring.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>

        <li>750 g minced meat (pork and beef)</li>
        <li>24 plates of cannelloni or 12 of lasagna</li>
        <li>350 g of homemade tomato sauce</li>
        <li>200 ml of white wine (1 glass)</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>200 g of sliced ​​cheese</li>
        <li>100 g of grated cheese to gratin</li>
        <li>Salt, pepper, olive oilFor </li>
    
    </ul>     

    <h3>The bechamel</h3>

    <ul> 

        <li>400 ml of milk</li>
        <li>25g of butter</li>
        <li>25 g of common wheat floursalt, pepper and nutmeg</li>

    </ul>

     <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>

        <li>- Prepare the filling. Put a little olive oil in a frying pan and add the minced meat with salt 
            and pepper to taste. Go moving and separating the meat with quite a lively fire. Add the onion, 
            chopped with a knife, when the meat is already browned. Keep stirring and, after 4 or 5 minutes,
             when the onion starts to cook, add the white wine. Put the moderate fire and, when the alcohol has 
             reduced, add the tomato sauce. Stir well and let the tomato reduce a bit. When you get the consistency 
             you want for your filling, remove the pan from the heat.
            </li>

        <li>- Cook the pasta. Put a pot with plenty of water and a little salt on the fire. When the water starts to 
            boil, insert the plates one by one. Cook the pasta according to what the manufacturer tells you. </li>

        <li>- Prepare the bechamel. Melt the butter in a frying pan over high heat and add a heaping tablespoon of 
            flour. Toast the flour a little and add the hot milk little by little, stirring constantly. Add a pinch 
            of black pepper, another of nutmeg and a little salt. Wait for it to start boiling again and you have the 
            bechamel ready.</li>

        <li>- Chill the pasta. Go removing the hot water from the pan and let cold water enter so that the cooking of 
            the pasta is stopped. Lay the plates on a cloth.</li>

        <li>- Assemble the lasagna. Put a few tablespoons of béchamel sauce at the base of the tray so that the 
            lasagna does not stick. Add the first layer of plates by matching them on top of each other so they 
            don't move. Place a layer of cheese on top and, on top, a layer of well-spread meat. Continue with 
            another layer of pasta, another of cheese, and another of meat. You can make as many layers of stuffing 
            as you like. Finish the lasagna with a layer of pasta and add bechamel 
            and grated cheese that melts well.</li>

        <li>- Put the meat and cheese lasagna, covered with aluminum foil, in the oven without preheating. 
            I have had it for 30 minutes at 220 degrees with heat up and down. Remove the foil very carefully 
            because it can stick. Re-enter the lasagna for approximately 10 minutes with heat only on top and 
            maximum temperature so that it gratins on top.</li>

    </ol>
